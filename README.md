The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

<b>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</b>

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 <b>1: 1
 
 3: 1,3
 
 6: 1,2,3,6
 
10: 1,2,5,10

15: 1,3,5,15

21: 1,3,7,21

28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
</b>

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

This project help you to find solution for random triangle number.
